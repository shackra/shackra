## Projects

### `goimapnotify`

Is a IMAP IDLE client implemented in Go that replaces some alternatives out there for script execution upon IMAP IDLE events. [Check project page](https://gitlab.com/shackra/goimapnotify).

#### Who is this for?

Most people check their email through the web browser, Outlook or through solutions like GNOME's Evolution or Mozilla's Thunderbird. `goimapnotify` targets that small sub-set of people that use alternatives like GNU Emacs [mu4e](https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html), command-line programs like [notmuch](https://notmuchmail.org/) or simply want to keep a backup of their e-mail somewhere.

As of feb, 2023 `goimapnotify` is provide by the popular GNU/Linux distribution Arch Linux at their [*community* repository of software](https://archlinux.org/packages/?name=goimapnotify), which in turn is inherit by other 9 GNU/Linux distributions that use Arch as a base.

Arch Wiki [describes `goimapnotify`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Isync#With_imapnotify) as a software alternative that "is reported to work better with frequent network interruptions."
